# Developer Utils Repository
Welcome to the Developer Utils repository, which contains shortcuts, scripts, code snippets, links, and other useful tools for developers. This repository is designed to help me optimize my workflow and improve productivity. Below are the technologies listed in this repository.

## VirtualBox - [VirtualBoxReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/VirtualBoxReadme.md)
It allows you to run an operating system (OS) on a different machine without having to install it on your local machine. This is useful for testing and development purposes, as you can easily create a clean environment that is separate from your primary system.

## Docker - [DockerReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/DockerReadme.md)
It enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, making them an excellent choice for deploying applications across different environments.

## Git - [GitReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/GitReadme.md)
It allows developers to manage and track changes to their code over time. It is an essential tool for collaborating with others on a project, as it enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts. 

## Vim - [VimReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/VimReadme.md)
A text-based editor that is designed to be efficient, with keyboard shortcuts and commands that allow you to perform tasks quickly.

## Linux Terminal - [LinuxTerminalReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/LinuxTerminalReadme.md)
A command-line interface that provides access to tasks like managing files, installing software, and monitoring system performance.

## MySQL - [MySQLReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/MySQLReadme.md)

## JWT - [JWTReadme](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/JWTReadme)

## AndroidManifest - [AndroidManifest](https://github.com/tbdbatista/dev-utils/blob/main/AndroidManifest.md)

It serves as a crucial configuration file in Android app development. It defines various aspects of your Android application, including permissions, activities, services, receivers, content providers, and more. Think of it as the blueprint that outlines how your app interacts with the Android operating system and other apps on the device. It plays a fundamental role in securing permissions, declaring components like activities and services, and specifying how your app responds to different system events. Understanding and properly configuring the `AndroidManifest.xml` file is essential for building robust and well-behaved Android applications.

For more details on AndroidManifest.xml, you can refer to the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro).
