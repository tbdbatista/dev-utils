# ZSH instructions

**Installation:**

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Install zsh using the package manager of your operating system. On Debian-based systems, run `sudo apt-get install zsh`.

3. Once the installation is complete, verify that zsh is installed by running `zsh --version`. You should see the version number of zsh displayed in the terminal.

**Setting zsh as the default shell:**

1. Run the command `chsh -s $(which zsh)`. This sets zsh as the default shell for your user account.

2. Log out and log back in, or open a new terminal window to start using zsh as your default shell.

**Using zsh:**

1. Upon launching zsh, you will be presented with a configuration wizard. Follow the prompts to set up your preferences, such as which plugins to use and what theme to use for your terminal.

2. Once the configuration is complete, you can start using zsh like any other shell. Some of the useful features of zsh include:

   - Tab completion: Pressing the Tab key will autocomplete commands, filenames, and directory names.
   
   - Improved history: The history command can be used to search and execute previously entered commands.
